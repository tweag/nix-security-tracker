# Hacking

The service is implemented in Python using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
It is built and deployed with [Nix](https://nix.dev).

Local testing is done on a [NixOS virtual machine](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/nixos-configuration-on-vm) (VM).

## Prerequisites

Follow the [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md) to run a local instance of the service.

## Interacting with the system

The [development VM](../nix/vm.nix) behaves like the production instance in almost every aspect.

The main difference is that source files in [`src/`](../src) and [`frontend/`](../frontend) are mounted from the host, so edits take effect without rebuilding.
The web server reloads automatically on change; background workers require a manual restart:

```console
systemctl restart nix-security-tracker-workers.target
```

The other difference is that startup and scheduled jobs turned off, as they're rarely needed for development.
Run them manually by picking from the available [management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/django-admin/):

```console
manage help
```

## Local configuration extensions

You may want to adjust the development VM, such as by adding your own tools for debugging.

The directory `.local` is not tracked by version control, so you can use it for local customisations.
The VM configuration automatically imports `.local/default.nix` if it exists.
That file is expected to contain a NixOS module.

For example, to add programs to the environment:

```nix
# .local/default.nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    htop
    neovim
  ];
}
```

## Running tests

Run application tests in the development VM:

```console
manage test -- --pyargs shared
```

Set the `--pyargs` parameter to test one of [the available Django applications](../CONTRIBUTING.md#directory-structure).

Run [integration tests](../nix/tests/default.nix) from your host:

```console
nix-build -A tests
```

Interact with the virtual machines involved in a test:

```
$(nix-build -A tests.driverInteractive)/bin/nixos-test-driver
```

> [!NOTE]
> Integration tests run [on each pull request](../.github/workflows/builds.yaml) and include the application tests.

## Debugging

For debugging, the web server can be run separately on the console:

```console
systemctl stop nix-security-tracker-server
manage runserver
```

Adding a breakpoint to the source will make it stop at that point:

```python
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
```

## SSH access to the development VM

In your [local configuration extension](#local-configuration-extensions), enable SSH on the VM and add your SSH public key for the `root` user:

```
# .local/default.nix
{ config, ... }: {
  services.sshd.enable = true;
  users.users.root.openssh.authorizedKeys.keyFiles = [ ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ];

  virtualisation.forwardPorts = [
    rec {
      from = "host";
      host.port = guest.port + config.local.port-offset;
      guest.port = 22;
    }
  ];
}
```

Then connect to the VM:

```console
ssh root@localhost -p 20022
```

## Formatting

Run the formatter manually with:

```console
nix-shell --run format
```

> ![NOTE]
> A formatter is run [on each pull request](../.github/workflows/builds.yaml) and as one of the [pre-push Git hooks](../nix/git-hooks.nix).

## Changing the database schema

Whenever you add a field in the database schema, run:

```console
manage makemigrations
```

Then before starting the server again, run:

```
manage migrate
```

This is the default Django workflow.

## Changing the caching schema or matching algorithm

For performance reasons, we [cache suggestions](../src/shared/cache_suggestions.py) instead of re-querying all linked items every time.
The schema for that cache is versioned, and the cache needs to be recreated when the schema changes.

We also allow [rematch untriaged suggestions](../src/shared/listeners/automatic_linkage.py) when there's a new version of the matching algorithm.

Both steps are done automatically in production on deployment, but in the local environment, you have to trigger it yourself in order to avoid unexpectedly long delays when starting up the VM:

```console
systemctl start nix-security-tracker-caching
```

## Resetting the database

Generate a dedicated keypair on your host:

```console
mkdir -p .local/ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f .local/ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then [request SSH access to a public instance](../infra/README.md#adding-ssh-keys) for the public key.

Expose the keypair to the development VM through your [local configuration extension](../CONTRIBUTING.md#local-configuration-extensions):

```nix
# .local/default.nix
{ ... }:
{
  virtualisation.sharedDirectories.ssh = {
    source = toString ./ssh;
    target = "/root/.ssh";
  };
}
```

Once you have access, delete the database and recreate it, then restore it from a dump, and (just in case the dump is behind the code) run migrations:

```bash
systemctl stop nix-security-tracker.target
dropdb nix-security-tracker
ssh dump-db@tracker-staging.security.nixos.org | zstdcat | pv | psql -U postgres
manage migrate
systemctl start nix-security-tracker.target
```
