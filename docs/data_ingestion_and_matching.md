# Working with data locally

This document shows how to fetch channels, run evaluations, ingest CVEs and produce untriaged matches on your local instance.

## Prerequisites

Follow the [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md) to run a local instance.

### Ingest Nixpkgs metadata

Fetch the tips of all [channel branches](https://nix.dev/concepts/faq#channel-branches):

```console
manage fetch_all_channels
```

The output will look like this:

```console
{'channel': 'nixos-25.11-small',
 'release_branch': 'release-25.11',
 'revision': 'c9bfd86ed684d27e63b0ff9ebb18699f84f27a3b',
 'status': NixChannel.ChannelState.END_OF_LIFE,
 'variant': NixChannel.Variant.SMALL}
{'channel': 'nixpkgs-25.11-darwin',
 'release_branch': 'release-25.11',
 'revision': '0921fdb3e13e40fe25fbc52b89661a9d6d32ac68',
 'status': NixChannel.ChannelState.END_OF_LIFE,
 'variant': NixChannel.Variant.DARWIN}
```

An evaluation of one of the channels will start in the background, and will take 6-7G of memory and 20-30 min on reasonably modern machine.
Without this, there's nothing for CVEs to match against.

Follow its activity with:

```console
journalctl -efu nix-security-tracker-evaluator
```

The output will look something like this:

```console

}

}

```

### Start matching listeners and ingest CVEs for matching

Matching CVEs against Nixpkgs metadata is triggered by `pgpubsub` notifications internally as CVEs are ingested.

> [!NOTE]
> `ingest_bulk_cve` requires a configured GitHub App with access to `CVEProject/cvelistV5`.
> If you see `InvalidKeyError: Could not parse the provided public key`, your GitHub App private key is missing or misconfigured.
> [Set up GitHub credentials](../CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-credentials) in that case.

```console
manage ingest_bulk_cve --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-01-31
```

This should produce untriaged matches.

### Offline matching training data

In order to measure matching algorithm accuracy locally when developing, you will need access to production data, which contains past automatic matches curated with corrections by users.
You need an [API token](https://tracker.security.nixos.org/user/tokens), and permissions to access the endpoint with your user account which you can request by [contacting maintainers](../README.md#contributing).

Fetch paginated user-curated matches.
Dump size is determined by number of automatically matched derivations (currently ca. 500k items).

```console
export MATCHING_TRAINING_DATA_TOKEN=<api-token>
manage fetch_matching_training_data \
  --base-url https://tracker.security.nixos.org \
  --output ./training-data/
```

`--output` must be an empty directory (the command refuses to overwrite existing files).
Use `--limit N` to fetch only a sample.

This will produce one JSON file per page fetched.

Import into your local database:

> [!WARNING]
> Do _not_ run `manage listen` during import.
> The command suppresses `pgpubsub` triggers so workers are not flooded with tasks.

```console
manage import_matching_training_data --input ./training-data/
```

Re-importing the same dump is idempotent per CVE ID.

Score the current matcher against those labels (read-only; does not create proposals):

```console
manage benchmark_matching
```

Reports true positives, false positives, and SNR vs kept derivations and ignored package overlays.
Prints one line per CVE by default.
Use `--quiet` for the summary only, and `--limit N` for a sample.

Remove a previously imported corpus:

```console
manage purge_matching_training_data
```
