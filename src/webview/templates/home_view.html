    The <strong>Nixpkgs Security Tracker</strong> is a web service for managing information on <em>vulnerabilities</em> in software distributed through <a href="https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs">Nixpkgs and NixOS</a>.
    It operates on the following distinctions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="inline-row gap-small centered"><i class="icon-inbox"></i><a href="{% url 'webview:suggestion:untriaged_suggestions' %}">Untriaged suggestions</a></span> are automatically generated matches between a <a href="https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary#glossaryCVE">CVE</a> and Nixpkgs derivations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="inline-row gap-small centered"><i class="icon-bin"></i><a href="{% url 'webview:suggestion:dismissed_suggestions' %}">Dismissed suggestions</a></span> are CVEs that already were classified by a human as <em>not affecting</em> Nixpkgs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="inline-row gap-small centered"><i class="icon-draft"></i><a href="{% url 'webview:suggestion:draft_suggestions' %}">Accepted suggestions</a></span> are matches between a CVE and Nixpkgs attributes that were selected as <em>security relevant</em>.
      They are slated to be published as a GitHub issue, but might need further refinement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="inline-row gap-small centered"><i class="icon-github"></i><a href="/issues">Published issues</a></span> have a persistent identifier and link to GitHub issues, which are used for notifications and coordinating mitigation.
    </li>
  <ul>
