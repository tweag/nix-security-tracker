        #
        # 1. The user can receive a notification because they suscribed to a
        # package. If they then unsubscribe, the notification will still be
        # here but the matching package will no longer be displayed as such in
        # the notification.
        #
        # 2. If at some point the package is ignored within the suggestion,
        # then it won't appear in the list of matched packages in the
        # notification. Once again, we may end up with notification that
        # seemingly match nothing of interest. Another implementation choice is
